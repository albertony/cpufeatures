/*

Minimalistic library for exposing the __cpuid/__cpuidex intrinsics, which can be used to check
CPU features (extended instruction set support) of the executing processor.

This library exports two functions, cpuid and cpuidex, which executes the corresponding
intrinsic function. The implementations handle the raw input and output of the intrinsic functions
to support a bit higher level easier to use interface: For instance instead of returning the raw
bit sequences of the four registers, it takes a register number and bit number as arguments and
checks if the bit is set. Return value is a nonzero signed integer if the bit is set, otherwise it is zero.

Exported functions:
  int cpuid(unsigned char function_id, unsigned char register_number, unsigned char bit_number)
  int cpuidex(unsigned char function_id, unsigned char subfunction_id, unsigned char register_number, unsigned char bit_number)

The interface are tried to be as generally simple to use as possible, for instance for
loading the library into a managed environment such as C# and PowerShell using DllImport:
- Exporting the functions using module-definition file instead of dllexport to avoid any kind of
  name mangling.
- Uses stdcall convention, which is the same as Windows API functions use (and exposed as macros
  WINAPI, APIENTRY etc), and
  the default of the DllImport attribute in .NET.
- Uses signed integer as the return type, same as Windows API type BOOL, instead of native bool
  since that is more conformant. For example in .NET the native bool type is 1 byte while in C++ it
  is normally 4 byte (int), which may lead lead to problems if not specifying the marshalling accurately.
- Specifies input arguments, which are all low unsigned integers, as type unsigned char, which is the
  same as Windows API type BYTE and also matches the .NET type byte.

PowerShell example:

	# Make sure DllImport will search for the library in the same directory as the current location in PowerShell
	[IO.Directory]::SetCurrentDirectory((Convert-Path (Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem)))

	# Import the native functions from the library into the managed environment.
